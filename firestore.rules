/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and project data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Projects, accessible only to project owners and team members.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/stages/{stageId}: Stages within a project, access controlled by project membership.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}: Tasks within a project, access controlled by project membership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Projects can be created by any authenticated user, but only owners and team members can modify or delete them.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Projects denormalize `ownerId` and `teamMembers` directly onto the project document to avoid `get()` calls in security rules.
