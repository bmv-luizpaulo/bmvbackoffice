/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and a shared access model for projects.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Projects, accessible to project owners and team members.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/stages/{stageId}: Stages within a project, access controlled by project membership.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}: Tasks within a project, access controlled by project membership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Project access is granted to owners and team members. This is enforced by checking for the user's UID in the project's `teamMembers` array or matching the `ownerId` field.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Project` entity contains `ownerId` and `teamMembers` fields to simplify authorization checks.
