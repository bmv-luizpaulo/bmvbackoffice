/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and project ownership.
 * Projects can only be created, updated, or deleted by their owner. Tasks within projects can be managed by project team members.
 * Stages are managed within Projects.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project information, accessible and modifiable only by the project owner. Includes references to team members.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/stages/{stageId}: Stores stage information related to project, only accessible by the project owner.
 * - /projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}: Stores task information related to project, accessible to project team members.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all users. Only individual user profiles are accessible.
 * - Public read access is not granted to any collection.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `/projects/{projectId}` documents contain an `ownerId` field, which is used to quickly verify project ownership.
 * - The `/projects/{projectId}` documents contain an `teamMembers` array, used to authorize task access within the project.
